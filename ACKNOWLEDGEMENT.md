how to build a language server and how to interact with an IDE.

I made use of some of the implementation details of lemminx to get an idea how
the language server protocol is implemented in 
[Eclipse LSP4J](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j "Eclipse LSP4J").

This is the source code for the blog post
[Implementing a Language Serverâ€¦How Hard Can It Be??](https://medium.com/ballerina-techblog/implementing-a-language-server-how-hard-can-it-be-part-2-fa65a741aa23). 
It was simple and small and provided the base for the first running REXX language server.
