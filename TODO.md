# This is a simple ToDo list with the next steps

* ~Count do/end and produce an error when out of balance~
* ~Completion independent of lowercase/uppercase~
* make UPPERCASE/lowercase/CamelCase configurable
* provide a warning if rexx is wider than 80 characters (per line or overall?)
* provide navigation support to a label/procedure or first assignment of variable
* provide support for rexx includes (external fragments)
