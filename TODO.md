* ~Count do/end and produce an error when out of balance~
* think about uppercase/lowercase convention for code completion
* provide a warning if rexx is wider than 80 characters (per line or overall?)
* provide navigation support to a label/procedure or first assignment of variable
* provide support for rexx includes (external fragments)
