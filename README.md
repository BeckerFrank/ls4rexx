# lsp4rexx

The REXX Language Server is based on the following Eclipse technologies

* [Eclipse LSP4J](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4j) 

Based on the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) it is nowadays possible to create editor language support for different tools. One is therefore not tied in with a technology.

This language server does not attempt to provide a real syntax check but sufficient editor support, e.g. code completion on labels/procedures or variables.
